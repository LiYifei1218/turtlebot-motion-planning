## ESE 497
## Experimental validation of robot planning and control algorithms on ground robot platforms

The project will involve the following steps:

- [x] 1) Assembling a ground robot platform;

- [x] 2) implementing existing robot planning and control algorithms (e.g., Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT));

- [x] 3) mapping environments using existing algorithms (e.g., occupancy grid mapping)

- [x] 4) testing the autonomy capabilities of the robot in navigation tasks.
