# turtlebot-motion-planning

## ESE 497
## Experimental validation of robot planning and control algorithms on ground robot platforms

The project will involve the following steps:

- [x] 1) Assembling a ground robot platform;
  - [x]  Hardware assembley
  - [x]  Software environment setup

- [x] 2) Implementing existing robot planning and control algorithms (e.g., Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT));
  - [x] Implemented RRT Star algorithm with captured map from SLAM

- [x] 3) Mapping environments using existing algorithms (e.g., occupancy grid mapping)
  - [x] Mapped simulation environment using built in SLAM

- [x] 4) Testing the autonomy capabilities of the robot in navigation tasks.
  - [x] Tested in simulation evvironment
  - [ ] Not yet tested in realworld environment
