# turtlebot-motion-planning

## ESE 497
## Experimental validation of robot planning and control algorithms on ground robot platforms

The project will involve the following steps:

- [x] 1) Assembling a ground robot platform;
  - [x]  Hardware assembley
  - [x]  Software environment setup

- [x] 2) implementing existing robot planning and control algorithms (e.g., Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT));
  - [x] implemented RRT Star

- [x] 3) mapping environments using existing algorithms (e.g., occupancy grid mapping)
  - [x] mapped simulation environment using built in SLAM

- [x] 4) testing the autonomy capabilities of the robot in navigation tasks.
  - [x] tested in simulation evvironment
  - [ ] not yet tested in realworld environment yet
